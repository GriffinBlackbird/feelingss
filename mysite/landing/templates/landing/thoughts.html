    <h2>Somethings I wanted to say ðŸ’Œ..</h2>
    <p>So...by now, your smartass fosho must have guessed what this website is all about, right? These days I am trying to enhance my skills in front-end development and saw no better oppurtunity
      than this to be used as a FUN way of commuincating with my CRUSH, okay okay relax..this ain't a love letter...Hmm again, I don't really know where to start from, I ain't got finesse
     in the letter writing skill ma'am, cause I don't type letters to anygirl except you alright, and you should be HAPPY about it ðŸ˜Œ. After writing a complete flop book my writing skills are already degenerated xD
     there ain't no way I'm gonna put my hands on that anytime soon..(much rather show how much like, only lang communi love, compliments from mind in the first page, immature and teens).
     I have been thinking about that talk we had that evening..listen, I want you to know that I think about you alot, and if there is even a small thing that's worrying you about me, or losing me
     from time to time, as I have promised seeing you sad or worried and that to cause of me, that's the least thing I will ever want, it's automatically my concern too, to reassure you, to be with you and make you realise that it ain't happening ever (may all the other boys who are or will try to steal you from me lose you, Amen.). Any worry other than that? It's your concern haha..No
     I would love to jump in them and apply my wired brain, but the fact is..an 'independent' fairlday like you won't enjoy that very much and no no, no sir, I ain't down for a beating in the middle
     of the streets as the autarchic girl (YOU) yells at me and tell me to mind my own business...Hell no. Kidding kidding, you know-I know, that I am here with you always and so are you for me.
     Kazmaire you know sometimes I sit and think why the hell do I like you this much?! and the only answer I get is serene-silence, and a deep heartfelt wide smile on my face...(DUDE WTH LIKE RIGHT NOW IT'S
     HAPPENING I AM SO EXCITED ALL OF A SUDDEN WRITING THIS). I don't really know why..and I absolutely don't wanna limit the reasons by adverting out a handful of things from a bag as big as Russia..
     Bored? I got it covered, fam, here have this link and check out the girl I adore, and then you better return here and allow me to torture you with the rest of the paragraph xD and oh don't forget to hover on that image! <a href="{% url 'image_flip' %}">CLICK ME</a>
      Don't read further..GO check that out first!

      I don't know if you need to learn this, but as I have said earlier and now I give it in written, the day we confessed, you became a for evermore in my life. Not to feed your ego, but you mean a whole lot to me already, your mood, feelings everything, and the need to make you smile..matters to me, and with time
      it will only grow, never decrease, so there is no way we will get distant or lose each other, and when it comes to 'Everyone I know somehow gets distant to me', I wanna be the exception, I WANT TO STAY, stay forever. I want YOU to stay, stay forever. There might be times that we might not talk to eachother for somedays
      one of us can be busy, both of us can be busy, there can be some mood/hormonal changes, but we will not let that define our relationship status okay? That if we didn't talk for 2 days, Arreyan/Kazmaire is ignoring me, or doesn't like me anymore or something like that. We both respect eachother's boundaries pretty well, and I am darn sure, if not the 3rd day, fosho the 4th day we will reach out to eachother, cause I honestly can't live without seeing you for 2 days,
      plus we have our little constitution so that's one bright thing too. You know, I think having the fear of losing someone..having relationship anxiety just makes you realise the true worth of that special someone that in my case is you.
      Now some honest talk, my 12th grade is almost complete, and who knows what will happen in the next 10 months, I might move to some new place for studies, but trust me I won't forget you. ROFL a funny thing, I am sO nIcE that I won't even cheat on my crush xD, if I like you, I like only you and you, there isn't and will be no one else. I don't want to make any pressure on you for liking me back forever or make you a prison of myself, you'll always have your freewill. I am not the best, not awesome, not handsome, but you know I'm trying my best, pushing the limits everyday so I can make a nice fortune for myself and you, I'm becoming a better human, and really thanks to you, I don't know I just feel like changing for you for the best, straight from the shoulder, I have a crush on you and my main aim with you is turning you into a girlfriend/passion in future and see where it goes from there and you should know it, overconfident much? Okay, I am not gonna have you as a friend forever, so after whatever 5-7 years or whenever we are ready, I am gonna shoot my shot haha, and well if destiny becomes a hardrock and changes her mind, then she is getting kidnapped.
      Might move some place else, might discover new people, but don't you think I'll prefer coming back to my childhood crush who is far more beautiful than any girl I know!? with whom I have so many awesome memories even when immature, just imagine the fun when grown-ups! Not saying that you are the one for me or I am the one for you, we are quite childish hehe to be making that level of commitments, but the thing is we won't know until we try. If you ever end up liking someone else, just let me know okay? times and again you have said that something like that won't happen but just incase,
      and I'll understand, ofcourse I'll be very hurt and you might become my gym motivation for a huge time and few other things lol (birch you better not!). Can it last?, Is it even serious? Do I even like her/him? Is she/he losing interest? Questions like this might cloud ones mind from time to time..if not now then maybe in future, and if it ever happens we will commuincate and talk it out!
      You know it's not just about liking someone and dating someone just for the sake of it and be heartbroken for the rest of the age for me, I would much rather see my crush become successful in life alongside me, with all the mutual support we deserve from each other. That shit is rare. Both of us have alot to achieve right now! and mind you, you have my full-fledged support in everything you might need it in. You know I had have a thought of dating you and all now, but again as we discussed, what will we even do xD and I am no fool whose gonna lose what special we have right now just to satisfy the urge of exploring some new grounds WHEN THE TIME ISN'T RIGHT.
      What we have right now is the best, and we will take it slow. Kazmaire, just imagine in future, we both are adults, we have our aims, something to look forward to, and then you have your childhood crush..ijsdhgfuysdgkfghasduy can you IMAGINE how awesome would that be! ofcourse alot will change in 6-7 years, but it will be the best!
      Ahh this is such a big topic, and their are like 100 of thoughts that I wanna write here but I should not, don't rush m, alot of time and I'll slowly slowly convey everyday how much you mean to me, so to sum it all up I just want you to be reassured that you are not losing me ever and I'll not end up liking someone else, I'll never back-off from putting efforts when I get the chance for us and so shouldn't you, even the tiniest of things are all we need to keep going, and never be shy or awkward to say anything you want to say to me. We will never confuse each other teehee, you know my intentions now wide and clear.
      There is no pressure on jumping onto something too quickly, we will make a healthy relationship and foundation and have both of our needs met, and be expressive about our emotions. DUDE IDK all these mature talks coming from my head? I can't believe, what have you done to me.
      Btw if you are looking for some compliments, you can find those on the first page written straight from my heart and mind. I tried making a contact form but it failed..so if you have to say something, if you think differently let me know :) If you want to say like 'I like you, Arreyan' which you MUST, email me, call me Idk just do it alright I need to hear it, oh and don't add a 'too' in it instead use my name. Also I miss you alot whenever we are away :) I would be very shy or numb to say all this in person hehe, but here these words are true and we might just prove it with our actions.
      Here one last surprise for you, Yeehee. <a href="{% url 'ilikeyou' %}">CLICK ME!</a> May this smoll website (although it's quite unartistic xD) convey some pieces of the efforts I wanna take for you, and this pretty much turned out to be a love letter sorta hehe guess the only language I know around you is that :) I am not letting you go, you are stuck with me. Distance makes the heart grow fonder, and you are worth the wait, Kazmaira Sharma.
